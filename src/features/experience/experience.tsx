              CareerBuilder is an employment website that operates in the United
              States and Europe. Here, We use data-driven technology and
              personalized tools to help match employers with great candidates
              based on individual wants, needs, and unique skill sets.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm working on the Talent Discovery Platform of CareerBuilder.com
              that provide solutions and services to employers and recruiters. 
              Recruiter can perform semantic search for the candidates, send the messages, jobs from the system and client can also add candidates to their ATS.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recently developed two new solutions for clients: Pay Per
              Resume and Pay For Performance.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  "Pay Per Resume" is an innovative approach to recruitment that
                  allows clients and their entire recruitment team to pay only for
                  the resumes that they view instead of having to commit to the
                  monthly cost of a license.
                </li>
                <li>
                  "Pay For Performance" model offers a more flexible way to
                  advertise all client jobs, and is designed to align what
                  client pay with what we deliver. When client qualify, client
                  only spend when candidates apply to their positions.
